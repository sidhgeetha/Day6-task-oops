//Regular method regular method we create a object for that class to invoke that method."
//static method is from the class itself. andn we can use it directly without creating object.

//Regular Method:
//You create an object for each movie.
//You ask each movie individually about its rating.

// Static Method:
// You don't need to create objects for each movie.
// You use a special spell (static method) that quickly finds all the movies with a specific rating without asking each one separately.
//when you use a static method, you don't need to create objects for each movie. The static method is 
//like a powerful spell that knows how to find all the "PG" movies in one go.
